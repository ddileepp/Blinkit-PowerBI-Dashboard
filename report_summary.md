## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. Revenue Concentration
A significant portion of total revenue is concentrated in just two product categories: **Beverages** and **Snacks**. This points to high dependency on limited SKUs, which are driving both volume and profitability.

### 2. Customer Loyalty Signals
Returning users contribute **more than 60%** of total orders. This retention level is strong for a fast-paced e-commerce platform and presents opportunities for loyalty program monetization.

### 3. Return Spike in Fresh Produce
Returns are notably high in **Fruits & Vegetables**. This trend likely originates from issues in packaging, quality at dispatch, or temperature control during delivery — impacting brand trust and operational cost.

### 4. Order Value Stability
Average Order Value (AOV) hovers around ₹25, showing purchasing consistency. However, AOV is significantly higher in Tier-1 cities, indicating premium buying behaviors and potential for product upselling.

### 5. Geographic Skew
Most sales originate from metro zones (Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi). While this is expected, Tier-2 cities show lower penetration despite showing repeat activity when acquired — indicating a scalable opportunity.

## 🧠 Trends Worth Watching

- **Time-Based Sales Surges:** Sales increase during evening hours and weekends, suggesting demand for dynamic pricing, express delivery slots, or bundled deals during these peak windows.

- **Customer Churn Behavior:** New user drop-off is higher than expected. First-time buyers who experience delays or poor-quality items are less likely to return.

- **Delayed Delivery Zones:** Certain pin codes consistently show longer delivery times. These may benefit from micro-fulfillment centers or route redesign.

## 💡 Recommendations

- **Enhance Perishable Handling:** Revise handling procedures for fresh produce — introduce better sorting and cold-chain checks.

- **Geo Expansion Strategy:** Consider promotional pilots in Tier-2 cities with growing retention potential and moderate acquisition cost.

- **Dynamic Marketing:** Launch time-sensitive offers aligned with peak behavior (e.g., “Evening Express Combos”).

- **Subscription Loyalty:** Introduce programs that reward repeat customers with monthly baskets, delivery fee waivers, or cashback.

- **AOV Upsell Strategy:** Target users with higher cart values for premium add-ons (e.g., beverages + health snacks, or groceries + kitchen essentials).
